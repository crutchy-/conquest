maybe try it as a web-based game so that you can play on your mobile

use javascript for client-side support

base on irciv

real-time

make infinitely expanding map (only store what has been discovered)

start with no warfare. just make so that units from different civs can't move onto tiles occupied by other civs

start with objective of expansion, trade, scientific development, city-building, etc
